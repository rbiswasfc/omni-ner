# Omni-Ner

Entity recognition is a widely used information extraction task, yet publicly available foundation models are not well suited for it. We leverage modern LLMs to create a small-yet-powerful foundation model for this task. This BERT-size model can be used to create custom entity recognizers with typically 5x less annotated data than before. This model is powering NuMind and we open-source it with an MIT license for everyone to use. Spread the word!
